# BMP IMAGE CONVERTER
This group project for COMP2510 is inspired by a topic from the CS50 course. 
We have expanded beyond the original scope by managing memory allocation, utilizing pointers, incorporating File I/O, and implementing various functions to apply filters to BMP images.

## Key Features: 

The BMP Image Converter supports various filters that can be applied to images:

1. **Gray Scale:** Converts the image to grayscale.
2. **Reflect:** Mirrors the image horizontally.
3. **Sepia:** Applies a sepia tone to the image.
4. **Brighten:** Increases the brightness of the image.
5. **Blur:** Applies a blur effect to the image.
6. **Saturate:** Increases the saturation of colors in the image.
7. **Threshold Filter:** Converts the image to black and white based on a certain threshold.
8. **Color Filter:** Applies a color filter of your choice.
9. **Invert:** Inverts all the colors of the image.

## Prerequisites

What you need to install the software:

- C compiler (like GCC)
- Make (for building the project)

Open and run the `main.c` which is the entry point of the program.
 
When prompted, type the name of the BMP file you wish to modify

for example: `cat` for `cat.bmp`

Next, choose a filter to apply by entering a number from 1-9 corresponding to the options listed under Key Features.

Choose a number from 1-9,
